START_PLANE	Junker	Scrap Pile 	It's charitable to call this a "plane" but for now she'll fly. It can do a little of everything, but can't do any of it well. Just keep an eye on the upper left wing - it's a bit wobbly.	0	0											FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0			
GI_SCOUT1	Pointer No. 1	Grimsby Industries	The Grimsby Industries Pointer, like all of their aircraft, gets to the point without fuss. Simple to operate and maintain, the Pointer is a reliable scouting aircraft, if not quite as nimble or fully featured as other options on the market. The No. 1's single light gun mount is suitable for self-defense and light duty attack, but should not be relied on against serious threats.	1												FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0			
GI_SCOUT2	Pointer No. 2	Grimsby Industries	The Grimsby Industries Pointer, like all of their aircraft, gets to the point without fuss. Simple to operate and maintain, the Pointer is a reliable scouting aircraft, if not quite as nimble or fully featured as other options on the market. With the No. 2 model comes new features, including an additional seat for a crew-member. A second light gun mount makes this version a more capable aircraft to use for interception duties.	2												TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	1	1	0	0	0	0	0			
GI_SCOUT3	Pointer No. 3	Grimsby Industries	The Grimsby Industries Pointer, like all of their aircraft, gets to the point without fuss. Simple to operate and maintain, the Pointer is a reliable scouting aircraft, if not quite as nimble or fully featured as other options on the market. The current top tier No. 3 model sees it with sharper teeth as well as more utility. A rear facing light gun swivel mount gives the second crew member the ability to attack enemies above and to the rear. The other addition is a single light underside bracket suited for a small bomb or set of rockets.	3												TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	1	1	1.1	0	1	0	0

NPC_BALLOON	Scouting Balloon 	Johnson Supply Co.	These balloons are Johnson Supply Company’s one and only entry into the aviation market. Lightly armed and with no armor to speak of, these simple craft are more like floating watch towers than aircraft. Their main line of defense is either air cover, or ground fire. The last line is firing their rifle as they parachute out before the thing falls to the ground in pieces. 	0				0
